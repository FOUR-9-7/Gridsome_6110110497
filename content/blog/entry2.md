## Summary


"If you want to go far, you’ll have to go up. A pair of sites split by an elevated center allows for rapid movement using two rope ascenders. Each site is built with a looming tower vital for control. Remember to watch above before it all blows sky-high."


## Map Features

Split was the first map to use ascenders. There are three sets on the map:

Two that allow players to get up from Sewer to A Lobby
One that allows players to get up from B Hell to B Tower
Four that allow players to navigate through Vents

## Update History



```
 v2.01
Increased the width of the B Main doorway
This should make the space easier to navigate for attackers, and make it more difficult for defenders to stall Attackers
There is a crate for attackers to utilize on the other side of the doorways as cover, which allows for utility to be thrown into the site from a new angle
Added an additional trash pile on B Site to prevent defenders from hiding in too deep a nook outside B Main doorway
Increased Spike plant zone boundary on B Site
New material stack for cover in B Site that allows you to isolate angles more effectively and breaks up a vertical 50/50 angle when peeking into the site from B Main
Reduced depth of a corner in Alley to allow pushing into defender spawn from B Site with more safety
Removed the cubby in Alley to allow pushing through this area more safely
Increased the width of the Vent Room entrance
Added a sloped wall in the Vent Room, which removes a 50/50 check when entering Vents from Mid
Removed a section of wall in the Ramen/Scuttle Crab (B Link) area to make it more open and allow you to push through and clear without having to rely as heavily on utility
Reduce depth of cubby in Sewer to allow pushing through this space more safely
Increased the width of the doorway to A Tower
Removed parts of the wall in A Tower to reduced safety of defenders
Adjusted angle of sloped wall on A Site to allow the back corner to be cleared slightly earlier from attackers
This angle is still safe from A Tower, however you can now successfully clear this spot by stepping out onto the Rafters without having to drop down towards site
Increased wall depth near Screens, which allows you to move out of Screens more safely without the use of utility
v1.09

Ascender acceleration adjusted to prevent sudden shifts in direction
This was only listed in the Patch 1.10 notes due to the change also mentioning ziplines, which didn't exist at the time until Icebox's addition later on in 1.10
Added weapon tagging when shot while on Ascenders
v1.02

Adjusted Defender Spawn to allow clearing angles to be a bit more straightforward
v1.0

Restructured mid chokepoint
We felt like Defenders were able to effectively plug up the main choke point in mid for a large percentage of the round. The new layout hopes to alleviate this issue. These changes open up the space quite a bit and provides an additional path to get around stalling abilities on the stairs. It also gives Attackers a few different angles to help siege B Tower and Vents.
Expanded our new system that combats map exploits to all other maps—this will eradicate anyone trying to escape the playspace
Continued to fix level collision in order to enhance the smoothness of the gameplay space
Completed draw call optimizations
Also continued to block spots for Cypher's Spycam.png Spycam that prevented counter-play
v0.50

Barrier locations (those clear blue walls) have been adjusted across the map to provide attackers more of a foothold into territory control across the map.
Defender barrier in B Mid has been pulled back. New barriers are in the entrance to Vent and atop the staircase in B Tower.
Defender barrier has been pulled back at A Ramps.
Attacker barrier has been pushed forward at A Main.
Attacker barrier has been pushed forward slightly at B Main.
Angled the wall on the left interior of B Tower when pushing up the stairs from Mid
This removes a 50/50 angle check when pushing into this space, which should make it more approachable for you to try and gain control of B Tower.
Radianite crate in B has been changed to a metal crate to provide more cover when planting the Spike.
Revised art to improve performance throughout the map.
Added fixes for Cypher Spycam.png Spycam exploits
Backside of spawn barriers are now opaque to prevent some abuse cases
Added ability for Spike to automatically fall from elevated boost positions
Fixed multiple spots where Sova’s Recon Bolt.png Recon Bolt could over-penetrate map geometry
v0.49

Multiple fixes to geometry to fix exploits and help optimize gameplay
v0.47+

Several exploits fixed
Orb moved from B Mid to B Main
```

## Sagittas ille leoni

Ministret est neque non. Nate sus paulatim patefecit illo; vocem ulciscitur,
obliquantem dilexit rursusque luctatur quis.

## Quod rear pugnabam primos de numen

Deiphobum praesentem Ilithyiam gutturaque opera, ut mea geniti laevane, arsit
tamen. Lux est in dextris etiam, per, mihi tenens easdem, tempus, indoluit. Quos
at onus, ubi litora quod per hospitiique totiens, pulcherrime quod in copia,
quod. Et modo Cycladas? Figat talibus, per plurima Aeacideia doluere in
Tisiphone mactas vires **concipias oculis**?

Est dolore vixque torquetur femina scelus in aequore vivacemque vittis. Fuit
vivat diversa! Aeolidis tangit inhaeret reddunt quid ferus?
